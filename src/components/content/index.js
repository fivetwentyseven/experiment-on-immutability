          The steps

          <li>
            <strong class="bg-light-gray ph2 pv1">Initial transfer:</strong> I
            transferred a small amount of ETH to an address I control. Its only
            purpose is to be spent as gas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="bg-light-gray ph2 pv1">Process images:</strong> After
            spending 1 hour online looking for graceful boobs, I cropped and
            compressed 4 images. I saved them as non-progressive jpegs. The
            difficulty was to strike a balance between keeping the boob
            distinguishable and creating lighter images to save on gas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="bg-light-gray ph2 pv1">Hex dump:</strong> Using the{" "}

            <strong class="bg-light-gray ph2 pv1">Transactions:</strong> The TXs
            needed to carry the hex dump as input data, so I crafted the
            transactions appropriately.

          <li>
            <strong class="bg-light-gray ph2 pv1">Gas:</strong> I adjusted the
